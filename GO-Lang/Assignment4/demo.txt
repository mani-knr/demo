A team can acquire players through either the annual player auction, trading players with other teams during trading windows, and signing replacements for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction and set their own base price, and are bought by the highest-bidding franchise. Players unsold at the auction are eligible to be signed as replacement signings. In the trading windows, a player can only be traded with his consent; the franchise pays any difference between the old and new contracts. If the new contract is worth more than the old one, the difference is shared between the player and the selling franchise.
